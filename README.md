# MITRON-BANK
Leveraging tools such as Microsoft Excel and Power BI, I've conducted an in-depth analysis for Mitron Bank's Strategy Insights project. Uncovering peak income utilization months and detailed spending patterns based on marital status, occupations, and city-wise performance, the data-driven approach guides recommendations. For high-income cities like Mumbai, Delhi, Bangalore, and Hyderabad, customized credit card offerings with premium rewards and exclusive partnerships are suggested. Conversely, tailored strategies, localized marketing, and enhanced customer education programs are proposed for low-income segments such as Chennai, Business Owners, and Government Employees.
